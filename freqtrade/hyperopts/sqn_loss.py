class SQNLoss(IHyperOptLoss):
    """
    Custom loss function class that evaluates the performance of a trading strategy
    using the System Quality Number (SQN) metric. SQN is a measure of a systemâ€™s efficiency
    and risk-adjusted profitability, calculated as the mean of the profit ratio divided by
    its standard deviation, scaled by the square root of the number of trades.

    This loss function aims to prioritize trading strategies that demonstrate not only
    profitability but also consistency and low volatility in returns.

    The higher the SQN value, the better the trading system. However, since the hyperopt
    process seeks to minimize the loss function, the negative of the SQN value is returned.

        Calculates the loss for a given set of trading results based on the SQN metric.

        Parameters:
        - results (DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the results of trades, specifically
          the 'profit_ratio' column.

        Returns:
        - float: The calculated loss value, which is the negative of the SQN metric. A lower
                 (more negative) value indicates a better-performing strategy.
