# Breakout with a Twist

From Kevin J. Davey's book: Entry and Exit Confessions of a Champion Trader

Everyone and their brother has traded or tested a simple breakout approach -- buying when new highs are reached. 
Makes sense, after all. Every up trend is just a series of breakouts to the upside.

The problem is most of the time breakouts fail. 
I have seen statistics that say 70-80% of breakouts fail, depending on how you define failure. 
The interesting thing is even with an 80% failure rate, breakouts can still be profitable, 
if the successful breakouts lead to big trends.

So, to eliminate some of the failed breakouts, this entry uses the ADX indicator as an additional criteria. 
ADX is supposed to measure the current trendiness of the price â€“ a higher value means a larger trend is in progress.

The entry will only take a signal if the ADX is indicating a non-trending period. 
This might seem counter intuitive, but the idea is that breakouts during a flat period may be more likely to produce big trends.

I have used this entry in metals.
